          My journey into design started from a completely different pathâ€”I
          spent four years as a Primary School Teacher. However, fueled by
          curiosity I ventured into the digital world to explore the realm of
          user-centered design. In 2019, I took a significant step in my
          professional growth by enrolling in Ironhack{"'"}s UX/UI Bootcamp,
          propelling my career forward and fostering an environment of
          continuous learning.

        <Paragraph>
          While design is my primary focus, I also enjoy challenging myself in
          other areas, including expanding my knowledge in front-end
          development.

          Beyond the tech world, I{"'"}m passionate about CrossFit, yoga, cats,
          and whipping up culinary wonders in the kitchen. Food is not just
          sustenance for me; it{"'"}s my second language.
