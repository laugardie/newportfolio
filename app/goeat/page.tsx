            Tourism is one of the world biggest economic drivers. During 2018,
            it grew 6%, reaching 1400 million travelers worldwide, according to
            the UNWTO â€“ United Nations World Tourism Organization.

          <Paragraph>
            Within this sector, gastronomic tourism is a growing market.
            Gastronomy is one of the main reasons tourists chose their
            destinations, and it represents 1/3 of the total travel costs.
            However, there exists a cultural and linguistic gap that hinders the
            exploration and discovery of a country
            {"'"}s gastronomy.

          <Paragraph>
            I embarked on a creative journey that began with the creation of a
            moodboard. Carefully curating a collection of images that
            encapsulated the desired brand attributesâ€”authentic, inspiring, and
            adventurousâ€”I embarked on a visual exploration to capture the
            essence of the app.

            To ensure the alignment of the moodboard with the intended brand
            attributes, I conducted a Desirability Test with 5 users.Their
            valuable feedback confirmed that the moodboard successfully conveyed
            the desired brand personality and resonated with the target
            audience. This confirmation serves as a solid foundation for the
            subsequent development of the app{"'"}s branding elements.
