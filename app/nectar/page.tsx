            , I embraced an exciting challenge â€“ building a brand-new design
            system from scratch. This meant not just creating the essential
            foundations, such as developing tools, refining processes,
            establishing naming conventions, defining organizational structures,
            crafting a unique brand identity, and creating a memorable logo, but
            it also involved the seamless integration of fresh components into
            our team{"'"}s Figma library.

            I made sure to keep these resources current, so our design system,
            which I proudly named {'"'}Nectar{'"'}, always stayed up-to-date and
            incredibly useful for the team. This allowed us to enhance our
            design workflow but also fostered a sense of unity and consistency
            across all our projects.
